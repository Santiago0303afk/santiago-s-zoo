<p class="description">
  The lion (Panthera leo) is a powerful and majestic big cat, known for its strength and dominance in the wild.
  Males have thick, flowing manes that vary in color, while females are sleeker and more agile.
  They live in social groups called prides, which consist of related females, their cubs, and a few dominant males.
  Lions are apex predators, working together to hunt large prey such as zebras, buffalo, and antelopes.
  Their deep, thunderous roars can be heard up to five miles away, serving as a warning or a call to their pride.
  Despite their fearsome nature, lions spend much of their time resting, sleeping up to 20 hours a day.
  As keystone species, they help regulate prey populations and maintain ecological balance in their habitats.
  Unfortunately, habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching have put their populations at risk..
